# dev-sensor-fusion-net
Unsupervised sensory correlation learning using Self-Organizing-Maps for multisensory fusion. Each sensory variable projects onto a SOM network which depending on the global network connectivity (1, 2, ... , N vars) connects to other SOM associated with other sensory variables. Extension to extract also temporal correlations using a recursive architecture.
